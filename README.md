# GodotProject1
Jump boy game, PC and android
This is the finished game JumpBoy.
I made this game using gdscript in the 'Godot' game engine.

I made the player sprite using 'Krita'. I have included the sprite images/frames in the 'PlayerSprite' folder.
All the other assets used were from https://www.kenney.nl/ and they were free to download.

All the music used were free music and I do not intend to sell this game and profit from it.
This project is just a beginner practice project made with the intention of learning.

To play the game, run JumpBoyV3

Enjoy the game!!
